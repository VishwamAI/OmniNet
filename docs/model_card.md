# OmniNet Transformer

## Model Description

OmniNet is a novel transformer architecture designed for efficient operation across various processing units (CPU, GPU, TPU, NPU, LPU, XPU) with advanced attention mechanisms and hardware-specific optimizations. It features state-of-the-art memory management through sparse attention patterns, Linformer-based long-range attention, and adaptive precision control for optimal resource utilization.

1. **Dynamic Head Pruning**
   - Adaptive attention head mechanism that specializes in different types of relationships
   - Dynamic adjustment of active heads based on input characteristics
   - Improved efficiency through selective head activation
   - Real-time head importance scoring and pruning

2. **Sparse Attention**
   - Block-sparse attention patterns for efficient memory usage
   - Support for extended contexts beyond 1024 tokens
   - Memory-adaptive computation distribution
   - Configurable sparsity factor for performance tuning

3. **Long-Range Attention (Linformer)**
   - Efficient handling of long-range dependencies
   - Linear complexity attention mechanism
   - Reduced memory footprint for long sequences
   - Adaptive projection dimension based on sequence length

4. **Multi-Hardware Optimization**
   - Compatible with CPU, GPU, TPU, NPU, LPU, and XPU
   - Hardware-specific precision handling
   - Memory-efficient attention patterns
   - Optimized performance across different processing units

5. **Layer-Wise Mixed Precision**
   - Precision adaptation based on layer sensitivity
   - Critical layer protection for embeddings and final layers
   - Dynamic precision adjustment during runtime
   - Memory usage monitoring and automatic optimization

6. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Key-value caching for reduced computation
   - Flash attention patterns for optimal memory usage
   - Extended context support up to 2048 tokens
   - Memory-aware attention distribution

## Usage

```python
from omninet import AdvancedTransformer

# Initialize model with advanced features
model = AdvancedTransformer(
    num_layers=12,
    hidden_size=1024,
    num_heads=16,
    ff_dim=4096,
    max_seq_length=2048,
    use_sparse_attention=True,
    use_linformer=True,
    device_config={
        'device': 'cuda',
        'precision': 'auto',  # Enables adaptive precision
        'memory_threshold': 0.85
    }
)

# Example for text processing with advanced features
output, attention_weights = model(
    hidden_states=input_embeddings,
    attention_mask=attention_mask,
    head_mask=None  # Optional: for manual head pruning
)
```
